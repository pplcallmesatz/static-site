# Static Web Site ![Static Web Logo](https://satheesh-design.in/static-web-app/logo-sm.png "Static Web Logo")

## Our Goal

Our goal is to create a static web page set up, working with SCSS. There are some dependencies to compile the SCSS to CSS, starting a local server and also browser live reload. Here is the boilerplate to automate all this process in simple steps. It also includes documentation for some mixins. Which made you easy to play :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye: with mixins.

<br/>

## System Requirements
For using this service,  your machine needs to have Node.js and Gulp pre-installed. If you did didn't have those please find the installation method. This is used to compile the `SCSS`, `livereload` and also for starting `local server`.
1. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
2. [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/docs/en/getting-started/quick-start) or run `sudo npm install --global gulp-cli` in  terminal

**Note:** You just need to install Node.js and Gulp, no need to create a project.

Documentation
-------------
1. [Project setup - Manually](#project-manual-setup)
2. [Project setup - Using Mac app (This is only for mac users)](#mac-app)
3. [Mixins](#mixins)

<br/>

## Project manual setup
1. Open terminal
2. Navigate to the project folder in terminal `cd your-project-folder-path`
3. Clone the repository `git clone https://github.com/swasatz/static-site.git`
4. Move the contents from the cloned folder to parent `mv static-site/* . `
5. Remove the empty cloned folder `rm -rf static-site`
6. Install all dependencies `npm install`
7. To compile SCSS to CSS run `gulp scss` , to watch each and every change in files(HTML, CSS, js) run `gulp watch`
8. To start local server run `gulp serve`

That's it you are all set, open http://localhost:3000/ in the browser. If any changes are done in the code, the browser automatically reloads and update the latest changes.

**(or) use shorthand method to avoid too much terminal commands**

1. Follow first two points
2. Run the given script in the terminal `git clone https://github.com/swasatz/static-site.git && mv static-site/* . && rm -rf static-site && npm install && gulp watch & gulp serve`

**:clap: you are all set...** open http://localhost:3000/ in the browser to view the page.

## Mac app
**:computer:**
This is only of the Mac users, simply [download the mac app and run.](https://satheesh-design.in/static-web-app/Static-web-setup.zip)
Since it needs to access external app(terminal) we need to give permission to allow access(Reference in attachment).

Starting the project for next time, you didn't need to run above app. 
- Just navigate to the folder in terminal.
- Run `gulp watch & gulp serve`

**Reference for mac permission**<br/>

## Mixins
The main purpose of a mixin is to make a set of properties reusable. Like Sass variables (where you define your values on a single location), Sass mixins allow you to define properties on a single location.

We have created mixins for most commonly used properties.
You can see the full [documentation here.](https://github.com/swasatz/static-site/tree/master/scss)
